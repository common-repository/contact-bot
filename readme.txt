A simple and friendly contact bot

== Description ==

"We think you should message a business just the way you would message a friend," Mark Zuckerberg said on stage at f8.

We think so too!! And that's excatly what this plugin is for. Once it's installed your users will be able to chat with you directly from your website in real-time using a simple and clean messaging interface and YOU, will be able to connect with your users anytime and anywhere using Facebook Messenger and Telegram.

Using messaging instead of the traditional contact form can greatly improve your site's conversion rates by allowing users to reach you instantly and by removing the high-friction user requirement to provide a valid email address.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `contactbot` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

You will find 'Contact Bot' menu in your WordPress admin panel. Configure your bot and MAKE SURE YOU READ THE "How to user" section.
